Node.js and npm:
React requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download and install them from nodejs.org.

Create React App:
The easiest way to start a new React project is by using Create React App, which sets up a new project with a sensible default configuration.

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Create React App globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g 
Create a New React App:
Once Create React App is installed, you can create a new React app by running:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-react-app
Replace my-react-app with your preferred project name.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change into the project directory using:

bash
Copy code
cd my-react-app
Start the Development Server:
Start the development server by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will launch your app in development mode. You can view it in your browser at http://localhost:3000/. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
